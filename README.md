Right now, it allows you to search for a book. It looks up the book on google books. The first result obtained on google books is passed to the libgen api (which allows you to get free books 😊). When you're asked "Download", enter `y` and press enter to get a list of results for downloading the book. Select one of the numbers formatted as `|||"number"|||`. By default, it will download the book through the browser, and give you a way to get it on your kindle.
